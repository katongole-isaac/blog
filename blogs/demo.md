Marked - Markdown Parser
========================

[Marked] lets you convert [Markdown] into HTML.  Markdown is a simple text format whose goal is to be very easy to read and write, even when not converted to HTML.  This demo page will let you type anything you like and see how it gets converted.  Live.  No more waiting around.

How To Use The Demo
-------------------

1. Type in stuff on the left.
2. See the live updates on the right.

That's it.  Pretty simple.  There's also a drop-down option above to switch between various views:

- **Preview:**  A live display of the generated HTML as it would render in a browser.
- **HTML Source:**  The generated HTML before your browser makes it pretty.
- **Lexer Data:**  What [marked] uses internally, in case you like gory stuff like this.
- **Quick Reference:**  A brief run-down of how to format things using markdown.

Why Markdown?
-------------

It's easy.  It's not overly bloated, unlike HTML.  Also, as the creator of [markdown] says,

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

Ready to start writing?  Either start changing stuff on the left or
[clear everything](/demo/?text=) with a simple click.

This is my `inline code`

```
{table} my caption
<table here>
sudo apt install
```

| Name       | Age | Profession       |
|------------|-----|------------------|
| Isaac      | 25  | Developer        |
| Jane       | 30  | Designer         |
| Michael    | 35  | Product Manager  |

# Custom Table with Explanation

| Feature         | Example Markdown Syntax                     | Purpose                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Table Header     | `| Header 1 | Header 2 |`                  | Defines column headers                    |
| Row Separators   | `|---|---|`                                 | Creates column boundaries                 |
| Alignment        | `|:--|--:|`                                 | Left (`:--`), center (`:--:`), right (`--:`) alignment |

: **Tip:** Use custom CSS or Tailwind classes to style your tables for consistency.

# The Journey to Becoming a Developer

Becoming a developer is a unique and fulfilling journey that requires curiosity, dedication, and continuous learning. In this post, I’ll share some insights from my own experiences and tips for those starting their own paths.

## Starting Out

Like many others, my journey began with a simple "Hello, World!" in Python. Little did I know, that single line of code would ignite a passion for problem-solving and creativity.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Consistency Matters**  
   Progress is built on small, consistent efforts. Make coding a daily habit.

2. **Never Stop Learning**  
   The tech world evolves rapidly. Embrace learning as a lifelong process.

3. **Build Projects**  
   Theory is important, but hands-on experience is invaluable. Start small, and gradually take on bigger challenges.

## Advice for Aspiring Developers

- **Focus on the Fundamentals**: Languages and frameworks may change, but core concepts stay relevant.
    - Languages and frameworks may change, but core 
    - dLanguages and frameworks may change, but core 
    - Languages and frameworks may change, but core 
    - Languages and frameworks may change, but core 
- **Join a Community**: Surround yourself with others who share your passion and can support your growth.
- **Celebrate Milestones**: Each step forward is an achievement worth acknowledging.

## Final Thoughts

Remember, the journey to becoming a developer is as rewarding as the destination. Stay curious, stay persistent, and most importantly, enjoy the process!

 console.log('no mercy');

```jsx

// this comment is here to demonstrate an extremely long line length, well beyond what you should probably allow in your own code, though sometimes you'll be highlighting code you can't refactor, which is unfortunate but should be handled gracefully

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { component: props.children }
